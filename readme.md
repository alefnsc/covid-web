# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Covid WEB, a project developed to showcase the concepts covered in Module 1 of the XP Educação Full-stack Postgraduate React.js bootcamp. The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that interacts with the public [Covid API](https://covid-api.com/api/), retrieves data using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), and presents the information visually through charts using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/information.html). Error messages are handled and displayed using[Tostify JS](https://apvarun.github.io/toastify-js/) when data is not provided.

# 2. Installation

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
